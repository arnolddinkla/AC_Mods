archcraft styling  mods
 - basically a rehash of the archcraft's beach style but lightened up a lot. 
 
   - Openbox
   - Rofi
   - Polybar
   - Mpd
   - Ncmpcpp
 
 - maybe throw in a custom startpage styled along the same lines - Startpage made into a separate private repository due to PI ( I styled it along these lines https://github.com/grtcdr/startpages so credit due to that guy)
